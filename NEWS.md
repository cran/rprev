# rprev 0.1.0

First release of the package, working with all features necessary to provide estimates of point prevalence. Issues which we'd like to address in future releases are:

  - Allow for other incidence processes than homogeneous Poisson
  - Enable more flexibility in survival modelling, rather than Weibull regression with linear covariate effects
  - Allow for the inclusion of more covariates in both the survival modelling, and the marking of the incidence process
